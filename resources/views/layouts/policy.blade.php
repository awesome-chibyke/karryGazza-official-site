                <p>
                    To enhance your workflow and extend the capabilities of the PostVille platform, you may choose to integrate with Third-Party Services—including applications, analytics tools, automation platforms, or CRMs—available via our App Directory or through custom integrations.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    These integrations allow you to synchronize data across systems, automate tasks, and enrich your social media management experience. Depending on the services you choose, connecting to these tools may involve sharing specific types of information such as your account credentials, campaign settings, or user behavior data.
                </p>

                
                <p><strong>Please Note</strong></p>
                <p>PostVille does not own, operate, or control the data handling practices of any Third-Party Services you connect to. Each third-party tool has its own privacy policy, terms of service, and security protocols, which govern how your information is collected, stored, and used. Before enabling any third-party integration, we strongly recommend that you:</p>

                <ul class="list-control">
                    <li>
                        Review their privacy policies and terms of use carefully
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Ensure the integration is essential and trusted for your workflow
                    </li>

                    <li>
                       Adjust your permissions and sharing settings within the third-party service, where applicable
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>By opting to use these integrations, you acknowledge that PostVille is not responsible for any loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to your data once it has been shared with a third-party provider.</p>

                <p>If you later choose to revoke access, you can do so directly through your PostVille account settings or within the third-party platform itself.</p>

                <p style="margin-top:10px"><strong>11. International Data Transfers</strong></p>

                <p>
                    At PostVille, we are committed to handling your personal data in accordance with applicable data protection laws, including the UK GDPR, EU GDPR, and other international privacy frameworks. Depending on your location and how you use our Services, your personal data may be transferred to, processed, or stored in countries outside of your region—including jurisdictions that may not offer the same level of data protection.
                </p>


                <p>
                    <strong>Transfers Within and Outside the EEA/UK:</strong>
                       <span>Our Services are operated and supported from our headquarters in the United Kingdom, with certain technical and operational functions facilitated by trusted third-party service providers located in Canada, the United States, and other countries.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Canada is recognized by both the UK Government and the European Commission as offering an adequate level of data protection. Therefore, when your data is transferred to or processed in Canada, it is protected under adequacy decisions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For transfers to countries that do not benefit from an adequacy decision—such as the United States—we implement appropriate safeguards, including the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) and the European Commission.

                <p>
                    <strong>Use of Subprocessors and Safeguards:</strong>
                    <span>To provide our full suite of Services, PostVille relies on reputable third-party subprocessors, including managed hosting providers, analytics tools, cloud platforms, and payment processors. These subprocessors may process your personal data in countries outside the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, and are contractually bound to maintain robust privacy and security standards.</span>

                <p>
                    By design, PostVille connects you with global social media platforms and third-party applications. When you choose to integrate your accounts (such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, or Twitter), those providers may collect, process, or store your data in multiple jurisdictions, in accordance with their own privacy policies and data handling practices.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We strongly encourage you to review the privacy notices of any Social Networks or Third-Party Services you link to PostVille, as we are not responsible for their independent data practices.

                <p>
                    <strong>Outside the UK/EEA:</strong>
                       <span>When personal data is transferred to countries outside the UK or EEA—particularly where data protection laws may not offer the same level of protection—we take appropriate legal measures to ensure your rights and data remain safeguarded.</span>

                    If we make material changes—such as altering how we collect, use, or share your personal information—we will provide a clear and prominent notice. This may include a banner on our website, in-app notifications, or direct email communication (where appropriate), so you are fully aware of any significant updates.

                    That said, we strongly encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of PostVille after any changes are posted will be considered acceptance of those changes.
